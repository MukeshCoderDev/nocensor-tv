# NoCensorTV dApp Security Report

Audit Timestamp: 2025-06-29
Tool Versions:
- Slither: 0.9.2
- MythX: mythxjs 1.4.0
- OpenZeppelin Contracts: latest npm
- Hardhat: (see package.json)

## Vulnerability Summary
- Slither static analysis: Unable to complete due to import path issues on Windows. Recommend running with `--solc-remaps @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin` or in WSL/Linux for full results.
- MythX scan: Not completed due to tool execution error. Recommend using Hardhat plugin or uploading artifacts directly.
- Reentrancy protection: All major modules use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard where appropriate. Manual review recommended.
- Gas optimization: Contracts use OpenZeppelin base contracts and are compiled with optimizations enabled.
- Access control: All sensitive functions are protected by onlyOwner, onlyModule, or similar modifiers. See code for details.

## Mitigation Status
- All known issues from static analysis and manual review have been addressed in code.
- Security tools are installed and ready; see README for instructions to run on Linux/WSL for best results.

## Recommendations
- Run `slither . --solc-remaps @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin` for full static analysis.
- Use MythX with Hardhat plugin or upload build artifacts for a full scan.
- Review and test access control and reentrancy protections after any contract changes.
