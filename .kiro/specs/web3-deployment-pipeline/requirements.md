# Web3 Deployment Pipeline Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive plan to transform NoCensor TV into a fully audited, open-source, and decentralized Web3 platform. The implementation follows three critical phases: Security Audit, Open Source Preparation, and Decentralized Frontend Deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Audit & Code Review

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want comprehensive security audits to ensure the platform is secure and trustworthy for users and creators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting smart contract audits THEN the system SHALL identify and document all security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN performing frontend security review THEN the system SHALL validate all user input handling and authentication flows
3. WHEN analyzing wallet integrations THEN the system SHALL verify secure key management and transaction handling
4. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL ensure proper authentication and rate limiting
5. WHEN testing file upload mechanisms THEN the system SHALL validate secure file handling and storage
6. WHEN examining payment flows THEN the system SHALL verify secure ETH and token transactions

### Requirement 2: Open Source Preparation

**User Story:** As a Web3 advocate, I want the platform to be fully open source to promote transparency and community contribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing the codebase THEN the system SHALL remove all sensitive credentials and API keys
2. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive setup and deployment guides
3. WHEN establishing contribution guidelines THEN the system SHALL define clear processes for community contributions
4. WHEN implementing CI/CD THEN the system SHALL automate testing and deployment processes
5. WHEN setting up GitHub repository THEN the system SHALL configure proper branch protection and review processes
6. WHEN creating release processes THEN the system SHALL implement semantic versioning and automated releases

### Requirement 3: Decentralized Frontend Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the platform through decentralized hosting to ensure censorship resistance and permanent availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to IPFS THEN the system SHALL ensure the frontend is accessible via IPFS hash
2. WHEN configuring ENS domain THEN the system SHALL provide human-readable access to the decentralized site
3. WHEN implementing Arweave deployment THEN the system SHALL store the frontend permanently on Arweave
4. WHEN setting up Fleek deployment THEN the system SHALL automate continuous deployment to IPFS
5. WHEN configuring multiple gateways THEN the system SHALL ensure redundant access points
6. WHEN implementing version management THEN the system SHALL maintain deployment history and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 4: Monitoring & Analytics

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the decentralized deployment to ensure optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring IPFS performance THEN the system SHALL track gateway response times and availability
2. WHEN analyzing user access patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights without compromising privacy
3. WHEN detecting deployment issues THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and trigger automatic recovery
4. WHEN measuring decentralization metrics THEN the system SHALL report on gateway distribution and redundancy

### Requirement 5: Community Integration

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to contribute to the platform development and participate in governance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting contributions THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and review processes
2. WHEN participating in governance THEN the system SHALL enable token-based voting on platform decisions
3. WHEN reporting issues THEN the system SHALL facilitate efficient bug tracking and resolution
4. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive guides for developers and users
