# Decentralized Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

Deploy NoCensor TV to decentralized hosting infrastructure to achieve true Web3 decentralization, ensuring the platform cannot be censored or taken down by any central authority. This deployment will make the platform accessible globally while maintaining its decentralized principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Decentralized Frontend Hosting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access NoCensor TV through decentralized hosting, so that the platform cannot be censored or taken down by centralized authorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN it SHALL be hosted on IPFS or Arweave
2. WHEN users access the platform THEN it SHALL load from decentralized nodes
3. WHEN the platform is updated THEN new versions SHALL be deployed to decentralized storage
4. IF centralized DNS fails THEN the platform SHALL remain accessible via IPFS/Arweave hashes

### Requirement 2: Production Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast loading times and optimized performance, so that the decentralized platform performs as well as centralized alternatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle sizes
2. WHEN assets are deployed THEN they SHALL be compressed and minified
3. WHEN users load the platform THEN critical resources SHALL load within 3 seconds
4. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want proper environment configuration for production, so that the platform works correctly in the live environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deploying to production THEN environment variables SHALL be configured for mainnet
2. WHEN users connect wallets THEN the system SHALL use production RPC endpoints
3. WHEN Arweave uploads occur THEN they SHALL use mainnet Arweave network
4. WHEN smart contracts are called THEN they SHALL use deployed contract addresses

### Requirement 4: Domain and Access Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the platform through memorable URLs, so that I can easily find and bookmark the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via custom domain
2. WHEN DNS is configured THEN it SHALL point to IPFS/Arweave content
3. WHEN content is updated THEN DNS SHALL automatically update to new hashes
4. IF traditional DNS fails THEN users SHALL be able to access via direct IPFS/Arweave links

### Requirement 5: Continuous Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment when code changes, so that updates can be pushed to the decentralized network efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically build and deploy
2. WHEN deployment completes THEN the new version SHALL be available on IPFS/Arweave
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous working version
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN DNS SHALL update to point to the new version

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to monitor platform performance and availability, so that I can ensure optimal user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the platform is live THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected
2. WHEN users access the platform THEN load times SHALL be monitored
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and tracked
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be sent to operators

### Requirement 7: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want backup and recovery procedures, so that the platform can be restored if issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deployments occur THEN previous versions SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN critical issues arise THEN the platform SHALL be able to rollback quickly
3. WHEN data is lost THEN backups SHALL be available for recovery
4. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the process SHALL be documented and tested
