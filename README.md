## How Video Storage Works

### Testnet (Sepolia/Mumbai):
Uploading videos on our test networks is completely free. There is no cost or token requirement‚Äîfeel free to experiment and make sure everything works as expected.

### Mainnet (Arweave):
When you‚Äôre ready to go live, each video upload becomes a permanent, one‚Äëtime purchase of decentralized storage on the Arweave network. You will be prompted to fund your Arweave wallet with the exact amount of AR tokens needed to store your file forever. Once the upload completes, your video is immutably stored across a global, censorship‚Äëresistant network‚Äîno recurring fees, no middlemen, and no possibility of takedown.

Note: You only pay Arweave storage fees once per video. Any excess AR you deposit but don‚Äôt use will be automatically returned to your wallet.
